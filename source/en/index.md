### Introduction

Qiandao Lake Lakers Kayak Club was found in May 2012. Qiandao Lake (also known as 'Thousand Island Lake') is a human-made, freshwater lake located in Chun'an County, Zhejiang Province. It is a wonderful place for a variety of outdoor activities. Kayaking is the best way to explore the beautiful shores, islands, and harbors of Qiandao Lake for thousands of miles.

Lakers Kayak Club offers a wide variety of trips and lessons for both kayaking and stand up paddle boarding. Our instructors are trained and certified by the American Canoe Association (ACA). No other shop in Qiandao Lake can offer the breadth of experience, knowledge, and ability that we do!
